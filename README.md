- 🔭 I’m currently working for Inditex as a frontend developer, using React and Typescript mostly
- 🌱 I am currently learning and improving on React and TypeScript, trying to achieve deeper knowledge of the technology, always maintaining good practices by applying and learning SOLID.
Also learning about GraphQL and developing microservices systems with Node.js
